# Rapid-AI-Model-Selection
R Shiny app that rapidly compares model performance of multiple AI models from the Caret package

Code based on blog post from Abderrahim Lyoubi-Idrissi (https://datascienceplus.com/find-the-best-predictive-model-using-r-caret-package-modelgrid/). Since this code was unlincensed and not available on Github, I started a fresh repo here to improve the application and adapt it accordingly. Please include original credits whenever used.
